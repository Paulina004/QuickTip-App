## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I ran into a problem where I could not access the Apple keyboard while running my live simulation. I searched for the solution to this error and figured out that I needed to press command+k within the simulation to solve the issue. 
- I was unable to figure out how to create a button that allowed a user to effortlessly switch between light and dark mode despite researching this feature online.
