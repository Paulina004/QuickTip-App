# Pre-work - *QuickTip*

**QuickTip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Paulina DeVito**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- Note: Please look in the next section (additional features) to see the optional work I completed.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
    - I added the name of the app in the navigation bar at the top. 
    - I added the SettingsViewController and created a settings area within QuickTip that lists steps on how to change the appearance of QuickTip by adjusting light and dark mode in the iPhone settings app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I ran into a problem where I could not access the Apple keyboard while running my live simulation. I searched for the solution to this error and figured out that I needed to press command+k within the simulation to solve the issue. 
- I was unable to figure out how to create a button that allowed a user to effortlessly switch between light and dark mode despite researching this feature online.
